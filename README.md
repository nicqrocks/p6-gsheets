# WebService::Google::Sheets

Use the Google Sheets API with Perl6

![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/nicqrocks/p6-gsheets.svg?branch=master)


## Requirements

A Google API token needs to be available. Please see the [OAuth2::Client::Google](https://github.com/bduggan/p6-oauth2-client-google/blob/master/README.md) for more info as to how to set this up. This module will need the `client_id.json` file from it.
